##### small study on sine wave glissados

---

Demonstration of an oscilator function that may take a frequency in Hz or in form of an `oscil` object itself.

That is, rather than being added to each other, the frequencies modulate one another.

###### Background:

This was first developed for controlling PWM LEDs on Arduinos in CPP, then I have made a JavaScript canvas rendition for demonstration sake.

This a small study, you may only benefit intellectually from it. No making money with this without my participation.
